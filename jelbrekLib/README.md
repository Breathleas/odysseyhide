# jelbrekLib
Give me tfp0, I give you jelbrek

Library with commonly used patches in open-source jailbreaks. Call this a (light?) QiLin open-source alternative.

# Compiling:

./make.sh

# Setup

- Compile OR head over to https://github.com/jakeajames/jelbrekLib/tree/master/downloads and get everything there.
- Link with jelbrekLib.dylib and include jelbrekLib.h
- Call init_with_kbase() with tfp0, the kernel base and (optionally, leave NULL otherwise) a custom kernel execution function, as your first thing and term_jelbrek(), as your last

# Issues
- AMFID patch won't resist after app enters background. Fix would be using a daemon (like amfidebilitate) or injecting a dylib (iOS 11)

# iOS 12 status
- ~~rootFS remount is broken. There is hardening on snapshot_rename() which *can* and *has* been (privately) bypassed, but it for sure isn't as bad as last year with iOS 11.3.1, where they made **major** changes. The only thing we need is figuring out how they check if the snapshot is the rootfs and not something in /var for example where snapshot_rename works fine.~~ Use unc0ver's code if you need the remount, I will probably add it along some bigger update

- xerub for the original trustcache injection technique
- stek29 for nvramunlock & lock and hsp4 patch
- theninjaprawn & Ian Beer for dylib injection
- Luca Todesco for the original remount patch technique
- Umang Raghuvanshi for the rename-APFS-snapshot remount idea
- pwn20wnd for the oiriginal implementation of the rename-APFS-snapshot technique
- AMFID dylib-less patch technique by Ian Beer reworked with the patch code from Electra's amfid_payload (stek29 & coolstar)
- rootless-hsp4 idea by Ian Beer. Implemented on his updated async_wake exploit
- Sandbox exceptions by stek29 (https://stek29.rocks/2018/01/26/sandbox.html) (& a few fixes by me for iOS 12+)
- CSBlob patching with stuff from Jonathan Levin and xerub
- Symbol finding (https://github.com/jakeajames/kernelSymbolFinder) & the CoreTrust bypass technique by me ;)
- The rest of patches are fairly simple and shouldn't be considered property of anyone in my opinion. Everyone who has enough knowledge can write them fairly easily
- sbingner for kerneldec

And, don't forget to tell me if I forgot to credit anyone!
